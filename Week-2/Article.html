            <h2>What is Lorem Ipsum?</h2>
            <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
                into
                electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
                release of
                Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
                Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>

            <h2>Why do we use it?</h2>
            <p>It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
                looking
                at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of
                letters,
                as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
                publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search
                for
                'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the
                years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>

            <h2>Where does it come from?</h2>
            <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical
                Latin
                literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at
                Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a
                Lorem
                Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the
                undoubtable
                source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The
                Extremes
                of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very
                popular
                during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line
                in
                section 1.10.32.</p>

            <h2>1914 translation by H. Rackham</h2>
            <p>"But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born
                and I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great
                explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids
                pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure
                rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or
                pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances
                occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us
                ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any
                right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one
                who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?"</p>
                <p>The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections
                    1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact
                    original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.</p>

            <h2>Where can I get some?</h2>
            <p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration
                in
                some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are
                going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in
                the
                middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as
                necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin
                words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks
                reasonable.
                The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or
                non-characteristic
                words etc.</p>
